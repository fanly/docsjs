## 🔄 Current Risk Assessment

### **Resolved Risks** (From Sprint 1):
- **Security Model Complexity**: Mitigated by clean permission architecture
- **Performance Degradation**: Resolved with efficient JWT + caching implementation  
- **Backward Compatibility**: Eliminated by architecture preserving original APIs
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Enabled rather than hindered by security-first design

### **Active Risks** (For Sprint 2):
- [ ] **Developer Adoption Rate**: Beta developer signup slower than projected → *Mitigation*: Increasing marketing outreach starting Mar 9
- [ ] **Editor Integration Complexity**: TipTap schema mapping has edge cases → *Mitigation*: Focus on core 80% scenarios first
- [ ] **Scaling Considerations**: Unknown performance under 100+ concurrent plugins → *Mitigation*: Performance testing scheduled for Mar 13

### **Emerging Opportunities** (Sprint 2+):
- [ ] **Enterprise Pilot Program**: Multiple organizations showed interest in pilot → *Action*: Prepare trial offering by Mar 20
- [ ] **Educational Platform Partnerships**: Interest from 3 LMS providers → *Action*: Complete academic profile optimization Mar 18
- [ ] **Format Expansion Requests**: Community requesting LibreOffice, Google Docs support → *Action*: Research feasibility Mar 22
