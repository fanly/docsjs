## 🔄 Daily Standup Points

### 🎯 This Week Focus:
1. Launch plugin infrastructure backend services 
2. Establish security scanning automation
3. Create developer onboarding experience
4. Set up community engagement channels

### ⚠️ Current Roadblocks:
1. Security scanning infrastructure needs vendor integration (waiting for API access)
2. Publisher verification requires legal template for agreements (legal process in progress)
3. Cloud service deployment requires compliance review (in progress)

### 🚧 Active Risks:
1. Plugin submission could flood review queue initially → implement community moderation
2. Security vulnerabilities might slip through early → multiple layer scanning approach  
3. Developer adoption might be slow → launch with 5-10 high-quality starter plugins

**Current State**: 🚀 **PLATFORM TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE** → **ECOSYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE IN PROGRESS**  
**Next Milestone**: 🎯 **PLUGIN MARKETPLACE ALPHA LAUNCH** (Target: March 15, 2024)
