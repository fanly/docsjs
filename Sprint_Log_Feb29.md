# 📅 Daily Sprint Log - March 1, 2024

## 🎯 Today's Mission Focus - Plugin Marketplace Backend

**Primary Goal**: Complete the core services for the plugin marketplace infrastructure

| **Component** | **Morning (9-12pm)** | **Afternoon (1-5pm)** | **Evening (6-9pm)** |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Plugin Validation Service** | ✅ Core validator implemented | ✅ Security scanner prototype | 🔁 Performance testing |
| **Marketplace API layer** | 🔁 Auth & rate limiting | 🔄 Search & discovery API | 🔄 Installation endpoints | 
| **Publisher Verification** | 🔄 Legal templates | 🔄 Verification workflow | 🔄 Compliance integration |
| **Security Scanning** | ✅ Initial architecture | 🔁 Scanner integration | 🔄 Threat database sync |

### 🚀 Morning Accomplishments (Completed)
- [x] **Security scanning framework**: Built plugin malware/dangerous operation detection
- [x] **AST integrity validator**: Created semantic preservation validation for plugins  
- [x] **Performance limiter**: Established CPU/time/memory constraints per plugin execution

### 🔄 Active Afternoon Tasks  
- [ ] **API Authentication System**: 
  - OAuth2 integration for publisher accounts  
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - API rate limiting and quota management

- [ ] **Marketplace Discovery**:
  - Search endpoint implementation (/api/marketplace/search) 
  - Tag-based plugin categorization
  - Featured plugin promotion mechanisms

### 📋 Tonight's Priorities
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Validate plugin upload-to-installation workflow
- [ ] **Security Auditing**: Perform penetration testing on installation API  
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Optimize API response under load

## 🚨 Potential Risks & Mitigation

### **Medium Risk Items**(Need attention this week):
1. **Auth API complexity** → *Mitigation: Bring in Auth specialist on Tuesday*
2. **Scanner false positives** → *Mitigation: Multi-scanner approach with consensus*
3. **Performance under load** → *Mitigation: Throttle requests and optimize hot paths*

### **Low Risk Items** (Monitoring):
- Publisher verification legal review delay
- Compliance approval timeline 
- Infrastructure scaling needs
